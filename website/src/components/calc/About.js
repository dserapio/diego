            Welcome to the e-Stewards Global Impact Calculator. This tool is designed to estimate
            the environmental benefits of recycling your electronic waste with e-Stewards Certified Recyclers.
         </p>
         <h2>The environmental benefits are measured in three critical areas:</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Green house gas avoidance</li>
            <li>Toxic metals diverted from export, dumping or disposal</li>
            <li>Valuable metals diverted from landfill or disposal</li>
         </ol>
         <p>These figures can be used to demonstrate and measure individual or corporate responsibility</p>
